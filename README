Gearhead Prime
==============
 
The giant robot roguelike GearHead, by Joseph Hewitt, has a sequel 
currently under development. There are several branches of 
development, actually; there is the original sequel GearHead 2, 
which is playable though unfinished, and there is GearHead Arena-R, 
a technology testing ground that is evaluating the use of Lua by 
trying to port the content from the original GearHead to a new 
engine. Both these sequels are still based on Pascal, which is 
something of a barrier to many contributors. So this project, 
Gearhead Prime, is an attempt to write a game engine in Python for 
use in a GearHead sequel.

Just to be clear: this is not yet a playable game.

Author
------

At the moment, Gearhead Prime is written primarily by 
Anne Archibald <peridot.faceted@gmail.com>
but it is based in spirit and to some degree in detail on the
original Gearhead, which was by Joseph Hewitt. Please focus bug
reports and complaints on Anne, since Joseph is not responsible
for any problems in this code.

License
-------

Gearhead Prime is made available under the same LGPL as the original
Gearhead.

Portability
-----------

Gearhead Prime has not been tested on non-Linux systems, but it is
intended to work there.

Dependencies
------------

This project currently depends on just a few pieces of software:

* A python 2 installation
* pygame
* numpy

All are readily available as packages under Ubuntu Linux, and probably
every other major Linux distribution. Probably Macs and Windows too, 
I don't know.

Inclusions
----------

Gearhead Prime includes a certain amount of code from other sources.
In particular, it includes a permissive field-of-view algorithm from
roguebasin, and it includes a modified copy of the python "yaml"
package for serialization of python objects. It also includes
images from the original Gearhead.
